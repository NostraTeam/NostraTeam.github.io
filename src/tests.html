    <h3>Test Names</h3>

    <p>
        The name of every test follows this schema:
    </p>
    <p>
        [prefix].[language].[execution type].[success requirement].[name].[test type].[number]
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>
            prefix
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The prefix of the library that is being tested.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            language
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The language of the test. This is either <b>c</b> for C test, <b>cpp</b> for a C++ test or <b>c.cpp</b> for
            a C test that was automatically converted into a C++ test (see <a href="tools.html#nostracmake">here</a>).
        </dd>
        <dt>
            execution type
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Either <b>bu</b> or <b>ex</b>. <b>bu</b> if the test will only be built but not executed; <b>ex</b> if the
            test will be built and the resulting executable will be executed.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            success requirement
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Either <b>s</b> or <b>f</b>. <b>s</b> if the test must succeed (s = success); <b>f</b> if the test must
            fail (f = fail). Requiring that a test must fail is often useful with <b>bu</b> tests, to make sure that
            a specific piece of code does not compile.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            name
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The name of the component that is being tested. If the test does not test a single component, the name must
            be chosen appropriately for the specific test.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            test type
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Either <b>wt</b> or <b>bt</b>. <b>wt</b> if the test is a whitebox; <b>bt</b> if the test is a blackbox
            test.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            number
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The number of the test (if two tests would otherwise have the same name, this is used to differentiate
            between them). Usually, tests will not have the same name, but in the case of tests that should fail
            (the success requirement is <b>f</b>), it is often necessary to have multiple tests for a single component.
            Also, this part of the test name is optional, if there is only one test with the same name (in that case,
            the number and the dot (.) that preceded it are just left out). Numbering starts at one (1).
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p><b>Example:</b></p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            ntp.cpp.bu.s.string.wt
        </dt>
        <dd>
            A C++ test for a project with the prefix "ntp" that should succeed. The test is a whitebox test with the
            name "string". Also, the test will only build the test but not execute it.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            ntp.c.ex.f.socket.bt.2
        </dt>
        <dd>
            A C test for a project with the prefix "ntp" that should fail. The test is a blackbox test with the
            name "socket". This test is the second with that signature, there is also another test called
            ntp.c.ex.f.socket.bt.1.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        The purpose of having such a strict syntax for test names is, that using <code>ctest</code>, it is very easy
        to just execute tests with a certain trait (e.g.: <code>ctest -R '.ex.'</code> can be used to run all tests
        that have the execution type <b>ex</b>).
    </p>

    <h3>Test Directory Structure</h3>
    All tests are nested in the directory <b>/test/</b> (see <a href="project_directory_structure.html">here</a>), but
    each test has its own structure that is nested in the directory <b>/test/</b>. The structure for each test looks
    like this (<bold>bold</bold> names are directories and names in <i>(italics and round braces)</i> are optional
    files or directories):
    <pre>
&lt;test name&gt;.wt.d
├── resources
│   └── &lt;resources&gt;
└── src
    └── &lt;test name&gt;.wt.cpp
    └── source.cpp</pre>
