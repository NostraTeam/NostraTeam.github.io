    <h1>Project Directory Structure</h1>
    TODO

    <p>
        The following tree shows the directory structure of a Nostra project, and the paragraphs after the tree will
        explain the contents of each file and directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that some of the names in the directory tree are not always the same (e.g. because the file name contains
        the name of the project). In such a case, the name of the file in the tree will contain something like this:
        &lt;project name&gt;. The paragraph of the specific file will then contain further explanations what the file
        name actually will be.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, to enhance readability, in the following tree, regular file names are written in a regular font and
        directory names are written in a <b>bold font</b>. In addition to that, there are optional files. These are
        written in <i>italics</i> and their names are surrounded by round braces.
    </p>

    <h3>File Details</h3>
    <h3>/</h3>
    <p>
        The root of the project. All files that are related to the project are in this directory of a subdirectory of
        it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that <b>/</b> does not mean that the directory is the system's root directory - it is just a placeholder
        for the directory that the project files are in (it does not matter what that directory is called).
    </p>

    <h3>/cmake</h3>
    <p>
        A directory that contains files that are used by CMake. As of now, the files in this directory are exclusively
        files that will be configured by CMake using
        <code>
            <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.8/command/configure_file.html">configure_file()</a>
        </code>.
    </p>

    <h3>/cmake/config.h.in</h3>
    <p>
        <i>optional</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        A file that will be configured by CMake. The configured file can be included using<br>
        <code>#include "nostra/&lt;project name&gt;/config.hpp</code><br>
        and it is meant to be used to inject variables from CMake into the C/C++ code.
    </p>
    <p>
        To inject a CMake variable, a new macro needs to be created in this file:<br>
        <code>#define MY_MACRO @&lt;CMake variable name&gt;@</code><br>
        where <code>&lt;CMake variable name&gt;</code> is the name of the variable that should be injected. Note that
        the name of the macro (<code>MY_MACRO</code> in this case) can be freely chosen - it is however common practice
        to make it an internal macro (thus making it start with <code>&lt;project prefix&gt;_INTERNAL_</code>) and then
        choose the rest of the name according to the CMake variable that will be injected.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Example:</b> If a project has the prefix <i>ntp</i> and the injected variable is
        <code>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</code>, then a good name for the macro would be <code>NTP_INTERNAL_SOURCE_DIR</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The default file that is generated by the CreateProject.cmake script creates a config.h.in that will inject the
        following variables:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>
                CMake variable
            </th>
            <th>
                Macro name
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <code>PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>&lt;project prefix&gt;_INTERNAL_VERSION_MAJOR</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <code>PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>&lt;project prefix&gt;_INTERNAL_VERSION_MINOR</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <code>PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>&lt;project prefix&gt;_INTERNAL_VERSION_PATCH</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <code>PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>&lt;project prefix&gt;_INTERNAL_VERSION_TWEAK</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
