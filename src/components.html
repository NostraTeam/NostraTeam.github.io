    <h1>Components</h1>
    <p>
        Components are a logical structure to organize features in a project.
    </p>

    <p>
        A component contains all classes, functions and other code that belongs to a particular feature. Also, each
        component has a header file, a source file, (at least) one test and an example. The source file is always
        present, even if it would not have any code in it (for example if all functions are defined in the header
        because they are templates or marked as <code>inline</code>).
        In addition to that, each component has a name that must be appropriate for its content. Usually, each
        component has a "main" class. If so, that class would usually have the same name as the component.
    </p>
    <p><b>Example:</b></p>
    <p>
        A component that implements a linked list may have the name <i>linked_list</i>. In that case the header
        file and source file would be called <i>linked_list.hpp</i> and <i>linked_list.cpp</i> respectively. It would
        provide the class <code>linked_list</code> and perhaps iterator classes for the linked list. Additionally,
        there would (at least) be the test <i>ntp.cpp.ex.s.linked_list.wt.1</i> (in this case, <i>ntp</i> was chosen
        as prefix) and the example <i>linked_list.ex</i>.
