    <h1>Examples</h1>
    <p>
        Examples are meant to be an introduction for a user into a certain feature (or, in most cases, a component to
        be more precise).
    </p>

    <h3>Example Names</h3>
    The name of an example is the name of the component that the example is for (or another appropriate name if the
    example is not for a single component) and a prefixed <i>.ex</i> (not to be confused with tests with the execution
    type <b>ex</b>). This prefix is used to identify an executable as an example.

    <h3>Example Directory Structure</h3>
    All examples are nested in the directory <b>/examples/</b> (see
    <a href="project_directory_structure.html">here</a>), but each example has its own directory structure that is
    nested in that directory. The directory structure for each example looks like this (<b>bold</b> names are
    directories).

    <pre>
<b>&lt;example name&gt;.d</b>
└── &lt;example name&gt;.&lt;language extension&gt;</pre>

    <p>
        Unlike tests are examples meant to have only a single source file. This is meant to keep the example simple.
