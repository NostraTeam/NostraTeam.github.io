    <h1>README Structure</h1>
    <p>
        The readme file is a file that is meant to be read by a user (thus the name read-me) to give information about
        the library.
    </p>

    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>
        Each item in the following list is one chapter in the readme file. Also, after the list, there is a chapter on
        this page for each chapter in the readme file that describes it further.
    </p>

    <h4>General information</h4>
    This chapter provides, as the name implies, general information about the project. This information includes a
    brief description of the project and the website that the project is hosted on (e.g. the GitHub link if the
    repository is hosted on GitHub).

    <p>
        Note that, other than the other chapters, this chapter does not have its own chapter title in the readme file,
        it follows immediately after the file's headline.
    </p>

    <h4>Requirements</h4>
    <h5>Usage Requirements</h5>
    The additional requirements that are required to use the library (e.g. third party libraries or other Nostra
    libraries).

    <h5>Build Requirements</h5>
    The additional requirements that are required to build the library (e.g. Doxygen to build the documentation or a
    C++ compiler).

    <h4>How to build</h4>
    A description on how to build the entire project from source. This includes tests, documentation, examples and the
    library itself.

    <p>
        At this point, all of the CMake variables that are commonly used to modify the build should be listed as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that different operating systems may require different commands, not everybody is using the BASH or a
        similar shell.
    </p>

    <h4>How to install</h4>
    A description on how to install the library when it was build from the description in the previous chapter and
    a description on how to install the library from an installer (if one is provided).

    <h4>Changelog</h4>
    The Changelog is a list of features that have been changed, added or removed from version to version. When a new
    version is released, the changelog of that version will be inserted at the top of the changelog.

    <h5>Additions</h5>
    A list of all features that have been added in the current version.

    <h5>Removals</h5>
    A list of all features that have been removed in the current version.

    <h5>Deprecations</h5>

    <h5>Improvements</h5>

    <h5>Fixes</h5>
